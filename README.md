# pomoDo | your productivity app @2.0.0-beta

## About the update

pomoDo got an update in the spring of 2023, that features the possibility to create and manage an account, with database persisting data. However, the update is not yet stable, as some options are not working, such as a persistent order in task list or photo upload. Calendar and statistics metrics may also cause issues while using the app.
